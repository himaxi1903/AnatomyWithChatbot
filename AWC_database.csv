"41";"Eyeball";"The eyeball is almost spherical, but not perfectly so, mainly because its anterior, clear, or corneal segment has a greater curvature than the rest of the eye. Considering it as a globe, it has an anterior pole and a posterior pole; the former corresponding to the center of the front of the cornea, the latter to the center of the posterior curvature. An imaginary straight line joining, the two poles is called the axis of the eyeball. The equator of the eye is that part of its surface which lies midway between the two poles. The optic nerve joins the globe three or four mm to the nasal side of the posterior pole. The shape of the eye depends on, and is preserved by, the outermost tunic, formed conjointly by the cornea and sclera. All around the cornea there remains a little adherent conjunctiva; elsewhere, the sclera is directly exposed, except for some loose connective tissue which adheres to it, especially around the optic nerve entrance. In front of the equator we see the tendinous insertions of the four recti muscles.

The top of this expanded bone forms the arched crest terminating at both ends as the anterior superior and posterior superior spines. At the posterior end of the crest the internal surface becomes exceedingly rough providing attachment for the sacrum.";"Anatomy_img/I/8.png"
"89";"Ischium";"It is an arched or U-shaped element with its concave notched margin contributing to the posterior two-thirds of the obturator foramen. It is divisible into two parts, a more posterior positioned body forming the thickest part of the os coxa and a slender anterior ramus. The superior portion of the body is the greatest contributor of the three bones of the os coxa to the acetabulum. It forms the posterior portion of the lunar articular surface for the femur and forms almost the entire rough acetabular fossa. The ischium ossifies from a primary center that appears during the fourth month in the body of the ischium. Around the seventh year the pubis and ischium join to form an ossified ramus inferior to the obturator foramen. At puberty a secondary center appears in the ischial tuberosity. This secondary center joins with the primary center anywhere between the fifteenth and twenty-fifth year.";"Anatomy_img/I/9.png"

"93";"Joints and ligaments of the radius and ulna";"The proximal end of the radius and ulna articulate within the structure of the elbow joint. This articular anatomy is covered with the elbow joint. Along the entire shaft of the radius and ulna, an interosseous membrane unites the two bones. This is a synarthrotic joint that functions both as a binding structure between the adjacent bones and also as a large surface area for muscle attachment. In addition to the interosseous membrane, a syndesmotic ligament, the oblique cord, also helps to bind the radius to the ulna. At the distal end of the antebrachial skeleton, the radius and ulna form a distal radio-ulnar joint. This is a pivot joint that is associated with the anatomy of the wrist capsule. The proximal and distal radio-ulnar joints participate in the movements of pronation and supination.";"Anatomy_img/J/3.png"
"94";"Jugular foramen";"The jugular foramen is the large gap formed between the jugular notch of the occipital bone and the posterior border of the petrous temporal bone.

Their upper extremities are on a level with the upper border of the twelfth thoracic vertebra, their lower extremities on a level with the third lumbar. The right kidney is usually slightly lower than the left, probably on account of the vicinity of the liver. The long axis of each kidney is directed inferior, and lateral; the transverse axis posterior and lateral. Each kidney is about 11.25 cm in length, 5 to 7.5 cm in breadth, and a little more than 2.5 cm in thickness. The left is somewhat longer, and narrower, than the right. The weight of the kidney in the adult male varies from 125 to 170 gm, in the adult female from 115 to 155 gm.

"102";"Knee joint and ligaments";"The relationships between the femur and the tibia provide no interlocking joint mechanisms or stability between these neighboring bones and from this perspective the knee joint is completely unstable. That is, there are no deep-seated sockets or hinge-like grooves that limit and stabilize the movements of articulating bones. Instead, the knuckle-like ends of the femur sit on the flat plateau-like surface of the tibia. The strength of the knee joint is dependent on strong ligaments and surrounding muscles. Although its primary motions are of a hinge nature, it is a complex joint with subtle rotational and sliding movements also.";"Anatomy_img/K/2.png"

"114";"Lateral articular facet";"The biomechanical function of each pair of facet joints is to guide and limit movement of the spinal motion segment. In the lumbar spine, for example, the facet joints function to protect the motion segment from anterior shear forces, excessive rotation and flexion. Facet joints appear to have little influence on the range of side bending (lateral flexion). These functions can be disrupted by degeneration, dislocation, fracture, injury, instability from trauma, osteoarthritis, and surgery. In the thoracic spine the facet joints function to restrain the amount of flexion and anterior translation of the corresponding vertebral segment and function to facilitate rotation. Cavitation of the synovial fluid within the facet joints is responsible for the popping sound (crepitus) associated with manual spinal manipulation, commonly referred to as ""cracking the back.""";"Anatomy_img/L/10.png"
