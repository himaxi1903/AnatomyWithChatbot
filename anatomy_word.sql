It has a single pointed root.', 'Anatomy_img/D/10.png'),
(41, 'Eyeball', 'The eyeball is almost spherical, but not perfectly so, mainly because its anterior, clear, or corneal segment has a greater curvature than the rest of the eye. Considering it as a globe, it has an anterior pole and a posterior pole; the former corresponding to the center of the front of the cornea, the latter to the center of the posterior curvature. An imaginary straight line joining, the two poles is called the axis of the eyeball. The equator of the eye is that part of its surface which lies midway between the two poles. The optic nerve joins the globe three or four mm to the nasal side of the posterior pole. The shape of the eye depends on, and is preserved by, the outermost tunic, formed conjointly by the cornea and sclera. All around the cornea there remains a little adherent conjunctiva; elsewhere, the sclera is directly exposed, except for some loose connective tissue which adheres to it, especially around the optic nerve entrance. In front of the equator we see the tendinous insertions of the four recti muscles.

(50, 'External aperture for cochlear canal', 'This small aperture sits on the rough inferior surface of the petrous temporal bone. It is a round opening to the cochlear canaliculus situated inferiorly to the internal acoustic meatus, medial to the carotid foramen, and anterior to the jugular fossa.

It contains thick walls of compact bone surrounding a hollow medullary cavity. The strong wall is thickest near the narrow center of the shaft where the medullary cavity is also most spacious. As the shaft becomes progressively wider toward each end, the compact wall of bone becomes thinner and the medullary cavity accumulates spongy bone. The proximal end consists of a short cantilevered neck capped by a smooth, round articular head. Rounded projections of bone form at the base of the cantilevered neck.

(495, 'Perforating canals', 'These are the oblique to transverse canals that connect central osteon canals with one another, the medullary cavity, and the bone surface. They are typically a little larger than the central osteon canals and can be readily distinguished by their oblique to transverse nature and lack of interstitial lamellar rings around their circumference. They distribute arterioles and venules from the endosteum and periosteum to the capillaries of the central osteon canal.', 'Anatomy_img/P/282.png'),
(496, 'Pterygomandibular raphe', 'The pterygomandibular raphe is the tendinous intersection, or seam, between the superior pharyngeal constrictor and the middle portion of the buccinator muscle. It attaches to the pterygoid hamulus superiorly and the posterior end of the mylohyoid line inferiorly. This forms the junction where the deep fourth branchial arch muscles of the pharyngeal wall and the superficial second branchial arch muscles of the face met at the oropharyngeal boundary.', 'Anatomy_img/P/283.png'),
(497, 'Popliteal fossa', 'The popliteal fossa is the fat filled, diamond-shaped fossa on the posterior surface of the knee joint. Its boundaries are the flexor tendons of the knee superiorly and the two heads of the gastrocnemius inferiorly.', 'Anatomy_img/P/284.png');
